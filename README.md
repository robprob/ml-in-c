# ML in C
**ML in C** is a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented with the help of native C library, [MLper](https://github.com/robprob/mlper/tree/main). This project was originally created for educational purposes as I learn C, with the goal of making lightweight, fast, and dependency-free machine learning algorithms.
