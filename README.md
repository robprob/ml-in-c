# ML in C
**ML in C** is a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented with the help of a native C library, [MLper](https://github.com/robprob/mlper/tree/main). This project was originally created for educational purposes as I learn C, with the goal of making lightweight, fast, and dependency-free models.

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/robprob/ml-in-c.git
   cd ml-in-c
   ```
2. Review model-specific documentation

# Features
## Models
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/robprob/ml-in-c/tree/main/linear-regression)
## ML Helper Library
- Algorithm-agnostic helper functions
- [MLper](https://github.com/robprob/ml-in-c/tree/main/mlper)
## Data Generation
- Sample CSV data and Python scripts used to generate
- [Sample Data](https://github.com/robprob/ml-in-c/tree/main/sample-data)

## Future Plans
- Improve MLper global variable usage (I am still new to C and learning how best to structure)
- Improve sample data generation and allow command-line interaction
- Logistic Regression
- GLMs
- K-Means Clustering
